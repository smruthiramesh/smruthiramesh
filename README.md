- 😷 COVID Research: <a href=https://github.com/smruthiramesh/MIT_COVID-19_Datathon> Studying the impact of shelter-in-place orders on COVID-19 cases, focusing on variance by socioeconomic status. </a>

Currently I'm working on:

🌭 Food: I'm learning Flask to develop an app that tells me what to make for dinner based on what I have in my kitchen!
